        After the monsoon rains subside, India experiences a rejuvenated
        landscape, making it an excellent time to travel before the winter
        crowds arrive. Popular places to visit are: Agra, Rajasthan, Andaman and
        Nicobar Islands and Madhya Pradesh.

          Taj Mahal, Agra: Post-monsoon is the best time to visit the Taj Mahal,
          as the gardens and surroundings are lush, and the weather is perfect
          for sightseeing.

          Rajasthan: The heat of summer subsides, and the landscape turns
          greener. The desert begins to cool down, and the forts, palaces, and
          cities of Rajasthan are more comfortable to explore during this time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Andaman and Nicobar Islands: The islands are ideal during post-monsoon
          when the weather is pleasant, and itâ€™s a great time to visit the
          beautiful beaches and indulge in water sports.
        </li>
        <li>
          Madhya Pradesh: Known for its national parks like Kanha, Bandhavgarh,
          and Pench, the post-monsoon season offers an excellent opportunity for
          wildlife safaris as the parks are lush, and animal sightings are more
          frequent.
